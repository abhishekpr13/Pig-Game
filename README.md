Pig Game
Overview
The Pig Game is a simple dice game where two players take turns rolling a dice. The objective of the game is to reach a certain score first, typically 100 points.

How to Play
Each player starts with a score of 0.
Players take turns rolling a dice.
If a player rolls a 1, they lose their current score and it becomes the next player's turn.
If a player rolls any other number, that number is added to their current score.
A player can choose to "Hold", which adds their current score to their total score.
The first player to reach the winning score (e.g., 100 points) wins the game.
